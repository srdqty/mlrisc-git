# MLRISC

I cloned the repo from here:
https://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/svn/smlnj/MLRISC

See http://www.smlnj.org/svn.html

I tried to keep history. I used the following command:
```
 git svn clone --prefix=upstream/ -T trunk -b branches -t releases https://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/svn/smlnj/MLRISC mlrisc-git
```
